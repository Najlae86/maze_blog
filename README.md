Project Overview

The 3D Maze Game is a puzzle-based adventure designed to test players' ability to navigate increasingly complex mazes. Inspired by my love of solving puzzles and the feeling of accomplishment after figuring out a tough one, this game combines challenging levels with randomly generated mazes, ensuring a fresh experience each time you play. I built this project to share that thrill with others and demonstrate my skills as a developer, creating something fun, challenging, and immersive.

Purpose of the Project

The main purpose of the 3D Maze Game is to provide a mentally stimulating experience for players of all ages. Whether you're a beginner looking for simple challenges or an expert ready to take on mind-bending mazes, this game offers endless replayability through its randomly generated puzzles.

Who the Project Was Created For

This game was created for puzzle enthusiasts, casual gamers, and anyone who enjoys the challenge of finding their way through intricate mazes. The levels scale in difficulty, making it approachable for beginners while still offering enough complexity to keep seasoned players engaged.

My Personal Focus

I focused on creating an intuitive user experience with responsive controls and ensuring the game was fun and easy to pick up. At the same time, I wanted to introduce dynamic features like random maze generation to keep players hooked on new challenges each time they played.

Why I Chose to Work on This Project

The inspiration behind this project comes from my childhood, where I spent countless hours solving puzzle books and playing maze games. The sense of accomplishment after completing a particularly difficult puzzle always stuck with me. Now, as a developer, I wanted to bring that feeling to life by creating an interactive 3D maze game that captures the joy and challenge of solving mazes.

The Result: A Challenging and Fun Puzzle Game

Through the development process, I created a game that provides hours of entertainment through its core features: challenging mazes, smooth controls, and endless replayability. The 3D Maze Game is not only a technical showcase for my portfolio but also a project that I’m personally proud of for its design, user experience, and the problem-solving joy it brings to players.

Data Flow and Architecture

Technology Choices
For this project, I used a combination of technologies that align with the game's purpose and functionality:
•	Frontend: SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer)

SDL2 was chosen for rendering and handling input because it allows the game to run efficiently across different platforms with a smooth graphical interface and responsive controls.

•	Backend Logic: C

The maze generation and game mechanics are handled by C because of their performance benefits when managing real-time processing and computations. Using C allowed me to optimize the random maze generation algorithm, making it fast and scalable.

•	Build System: Cmake

I used CMake for its ability to handle cross-platform builds with ease. It simplified the building process across different systems, ensuring that the project runs consistently regardless of the development environment.

Technical Takeaways

Developing this game taught me how important it is to think through the entire architecture of a project before starting. Designing a random maze generation algorithm that adapts to the player’s progress required not only algorithmic thinking but also careful planning to ensure the levels provided the right amount of challenge at every stage.
Moreover, I learned a lot about optimizing code for performance, particularly when working with real-time applications. Using C allowed me to dive deeper into memory management and efficiency, which became crucial as the complexity of the mazes increased.

What I Would Do Differently

If I were to tackle this project again, I would focus more on polishing the user interface and making it more visually appealing. While the gameplay is smooth, there are some graphical improvements and animations that I would like to integrate to make the experience more immersive. I would also consider using a game engine like Unity or Unreal Engine to streamline some aspects of the development process, especially for handling 3D rendering.

What I Learned About Myself as an Engineer

This project helped me realize that I thrive on solving complex problems and enjoy working on projects that require a balance of creativity and technical expertise. The challenge of creating a game from scratch allowed me to apply a wide range of skills, from coding to design, and helped me grow as a developer.
I also learned that I enjoy the process of building interactive experiences for users. Seeing the game come to life and watching others enjoy playing it was a deeply rewarding experience that solidified my interest in game development as a career path.

How This Project Informs My Future Engineering Path

Working on the 3D Maze Game has solidified my interest in pursuing more complex game development projects in the future. I’m particularly interested in exploring other areas like AI-driven gameplay, procedural content generation, and immersive virtual reality experiences. This project has laid the foundation for more ambitious games that I want to build, focusing on creating dynamic and engaging user experiences.

Confirmed Beliefs

Before this project, I had the belief that C is one of the most powerful programming languages for performance-intensive applications. This project confirmed that belief, as I saw firsthand how C enabled me to create a fast, responsive game with a random maze generation algorithm that didn’t compromise on performance, even as the complexity increased.

About Me

I'm a software developer with a passion for problem-solving and creating engaging user experiences. I have a strong background in C and have worked on various projects ranging from web development to game design. My ultimate goal is to merge my technical skills with my love for gaming to create immersive, interactive experiences for users.
